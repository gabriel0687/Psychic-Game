Game Homework

In this game I created the computer is going to pick a random letter and the user has to guess witch letter it is, if the user get it right
the the user gets a WIN and the game starts again. if the user doesnt guess the letter, the user has 9 oportunities to do it, if it cant 
guess it in 9 oportunities then the user will get a LOST.
If the user keep guessing then the counter of WINS keep raising, as well as the looses counter if the user keeps failing
